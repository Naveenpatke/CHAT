To create the docker group and add your user:

Create the docker group.

$ sudo groupadd docker
Add your user to the docker group.

$ sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
Log out and log back in so that your group membership is re-evaluated.

If testing on a virtual machine, it may be necessary to restart the virtual machine for changes to take effect.

On a desktop Linux environment such as X Windows, log out of your session completely and then log back in.

On Linux, you can also run the following command to activate the changes to groups:

$ newgrp docker 
Verify that you can run docker commands without sudo.

$ docker run hello-world
